# Changelog

Notable changes to Dockmesh, loosely following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Every user-visible pull request adds a line under `[Unreleased]`. Pull requests users won't
notice (CI, refactoring, tests) carry the `no-changelog` label instead. Releases up to and
including v0.3.3 predate this file; their notes are on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Dockmesh/dockmesh/releases).

Release notes on GitHub and the `release-manifest.json` asset of each release are generated
from this file by `scripts/relmanifest`, so it follows a strict format:

- A release header is `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD [severity]`, where severity is `security`
  (update as soon as possible), `recommended` or `normal`. To cut a release, rename
  `[Unreleased]` to the new header and add a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` above it.
- Text between the header and the first `###` is the release summary. An optional line
  `Minimum upgrade from: X.Y.Z` there names the oldest version that can upgrade directly.
- Subsections are `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Security` and
  `### Upgrade notes`; each holds `- ` bullets (indented lines continue a bullet).
- A Security bullet of the form `- GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (critical|high|moderate|low): Title`
  is published as an advisory.
- Every Upgrade notes bullet is something a person has to do after upgrading and starts with
  `[id, audience]`, where `id` is a short kebab-case name that stays fixed and audience is
  `all` or `admins`: `- [sftp-host-key, admins] Re-save each SFTP backup target.`

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Each release now ships a `release-manifest.json` with its severity, advisories and
  required upgrade steps, and its release notes are taken from this changelog.
- When something needs your attention after an upgrade, Dockmesh now shows it as a banner
  and at the top of the notifications drawer, with a link to where you fix it. The notice
  goes away on its own once the issue is fixed; non-critical ones can be hidden from the
  banner.

### Changed
- API tokens now belong to the user who created them. A token never grants more than its
  role and its owner's current permissions and host scope allow, and it stops working when
  the owner is deleted. A token created with another token expires no later than it, and a
  token can only revoke itself.
- Turning off two-factor authentication, or replacing the authenticator, now asks for a
  current code or a recovery code; after five wrong codes it is blocked for 15 minutes. Admins
  can no longer use the user-management reset on their own account.
- Changing your password signs out your other sessions; an admin password reset (in the UI
  or with `dockmesh admin reset-password`) signs out all of the user's sessions.
- A role or scope change now applies to a signed-in user's next request instead of after up
  to 15 minutes.

### Security
- Each kind of signed token (session, refresh, two-factor challenge, WebSocket ticket, single
  sign-on state) now has its own key and is only accepted for its own purpose. Before, a
  half-finished two-factor login could be used to turn two-factor authentication off.
- WebSocket connections for container exec, logs, stats and events now run with the
  permissions and host scope of the user who opened them, and each ticket works only once.
  Before, a user restricted to some stacks or hosts could open a shell in any container.
  Open connections close when the session is signed out or the permission is taken away,
  and exec sessions are now recorded in the audit log.
- Signing in with an unknown username takes as long as with a wrong password, and invalid
  API tokens can no longer tie up the server with expensive hash checks.
- The setup wizard's connection test only reaches public addresses and this server's own
  address on its web port, 80 or 443, so it can no longer be used to probe the internal
  network, local services or cloud metadata.
  The wizard runs one install at a time, its check endpoints stop answering when the setup
  window closes, and it reopens only when no account can administer Dockmesh (custom roles
  included). It no longer adds an existing system account to the `docker` group; only an
  account the wizard creates itself is added.
- Reinstalling over an existing install no longer reopens the setup wizard to anyone who can
  reach the server. `DOCKMESH_SETUP_FORCE=true` in the env file is now ignored once an admin
  account exists, and admins get a notice to remove it; the wizard also refuses to finish if
  an admin was created in the meantime. The installer only writes that flag on a host without
  an earlier install, keeps a copy of an existing env file as `dockmesh.env.bak` (or
  `dockmesh.env.bak.<timestamp>.<n>` if a backup is already there), and refuses to write
  through symlinks in the data directory.

### Upgrade notes
- [re-login, all] Everyone is signed out once by the upgrade and has to sign in again. The
  sign-in page says why.
- [legacy-api-tokens, admins] API tokens created before this version have no owner. They keep
  working and are marked "legacy" under API tokens; recreate each one while signed in as the
  user who should own it, then revoke the old one. A notice stays up until none are left.
- [setup-force-flag, admins] If a notice says the setup flag was ignored, delete the
  `DOCKMESH_SETUP_FORCE=true` line from the env file it names (by default
  `/var/lib/dockmesh/dockmesh.env`) and restart Dockmesh. The notice goes away after the restart.
